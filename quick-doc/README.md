# NGC Quick Doc

This is a minimal documentation based on
[`@publicodes/react-ui`](https://publi.codes/docs/api/react-ui) and
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to help you to implement the model and have a quick
feedback.

## To start

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm && cd quick-doc && pnpm i

# start the development server
pnpm dev

# start the client
pnpm doc
```
