    This question allows us to adjust the footprint of your diet according to your habits about the local nature of your purchases.

    We consider "local" to be food that comes from the region where you live or from nearby regions. If you eat "Swiss", consider your food to be local.

    This criterion has a relatively low impact, because the share of transport in the carbon footprint of the products we consume is lower than the emissions linked to production, processing or packaging, especially when your diet is meat-based.

    But it's still a win-win situation, and the benefits of eating locally don't stop at the climate footprint.

    > ‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful, if you do your shopping by car several kilometres from home each week, it's possible that the last kilometre's footprint will exceed the gains from eating locally!

    Consumers in Greater Geneva - including those in neighbouring France - bought 23,200 tonnes of clothing, footwear and household textiles in 2019. Most of this huge quantity of textiles comes from fast-fashion chains.

    To make jeans, for example, cotton grown in India or Africa is used, generating numerous environmental and social impacts. The cotton is dyed in another country, then sent back to Asia for manufacture, before finally being sold in France and all over the world. In this way, it can make its way around the planet. In each of these countries, at each stage of its life cycle, this garment has major environmental and social consequences.

    Around 85% of a household's final energy consumption goes on heating and hot water.

    As well as having a significant financial cost, this energy consumption increases the carbon footprint of households.

    However, it can easily be limited by lowering the temperature of occupied rooms without losing thermal comfort or feeling cold.

    For example, set the temperature at between 19¬∞ and 21¬∞C in rooms that are occupied during the day (and 17¬∞C at night or in rooms that are not very busy).

    Lowering the heating temperature by 1¬∞C represents <a href="https://www.ge.ch/document/30986/annexe/0">energy savings of 7% to 10%</a>. This may not seem much on an individual scale, but if everyone takes this action, it is a powerful lever for reducing CO2 emissions.

    Windows should of course be kept closed. To air your home, and if you don't have mechanical ventilation, open the windows wide 1x a day for 5 to 10 minutes a day.

    Good management of blinds and shutters will increase your comfort and further reduce emissions from your home: opening them during the day will allow you to benefit from the sun's energy, while closing them at night will increase your comfort and reduce heat loss.

    A district heating network is a system of pipes used to transport locally produced heat, mainly from renewable and recovered energy sources, to a number of buildings.

    It is an ecological and economical alternative to gas or oil-fired boilers, for both apartment blocks and offices.

    However, being connected to a heating network is not as simple as taking out an electricity contract. The feasibility of connection depends on <a href=" https://www.ge.ch/installations-chauffage-batiment/se-raccorder-reseau-chauffage-distance">a number of technical conditions</a>.

    Firstly, the connection is for an entire building: it is not possible to connect just your flat. Secondly, you need to check that there is a heating network close to the building, and then study the heating infrastructure within the building (a building with a collective heating system will allow you to connect at a lower cost)

    As far as the impact on the climate is concerned, a heating network is generally supplied by local renewable or recovered energy sources (at least 50% in Geneva, with a target of 80% by 2030), i.e. by incinerating household waste, burning biomass or using geothermal energy, which considerably reduces the CO2 impact of the kWh of energy consumed compared with gas or oil.

    Do you want to reduce your carbon footprint by changing your eating habits, eating less animal products and preserving marine resources?

    By not eating fish more than twice a week, you can significantly reduce your greenhouse gas emissions. It's also a good way of avoiding the depletion of certain species of fish that are fished too heavily.
alimentation . repas . poisson faible empreinte:

  titre: Prefer oily fish (tuna, salmon...)
  description: |
    The choice of fish we eat has an impact on our carbon footprint. Fishing, transporting, preparing and storing white fish rather than oily fish consumes more energy and therefore emits more greenhouse gases.

    On average, a meal with white fish has a carbon footprint 50% higher than a meal with fish such as tuna, mackerel, salmon or sardines.
alimentation . repas . viande faible empreinte:
  applicable si: plats . viande rouge . nombre > 0

    Not all meat has the same impact on the climate. To reduce your carbon footprint, it's better to eat poultry or pork rather than beef, veal, mutton or lamb.

    Poultry requires less food than other animals to grow. So less energy and water are used to produce the cereals that will feed the animals. Above all, chickens do not emit methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.

    What's more, eating less meat and charcuterie is good for your health, because eaten in excess, meat and charcuterie increase the risk of colorectal cancer. It's best to avoid eating meat every day (for adults, limit to 500g of meat per week, i.e. 2 to 3 steaks, and 15g of charcuterie, i.e. the equivalent of 3 slices of sausage)

    Adopting a vegetarian diet, with no meat or fish but eggs, milk, cheese and yoghurt, will significantly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions generated by your diet.

    Include more legumes in your menus. They will provide you with vegetable proteins.

    Eliminating all animal proteins (meat, fish, eggs, dairy products) from your diet greatly reduces greenhouse gas emissions. This vegan diet must be applied with great care.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution! The vegan diet is not suitable for everyone. There is a high risk of deficiencies, particularly among children, pregnant women and the frail.
    If you're thinking about adopting this diet, be sure to talk to your doctor, so that he or she can check that it won't be to the detriment of your health.
alimentation . boisson . r√©duire boissons sucr√©es . max un litres par semaine:

    The carbon footprint of sugary drinks is far from negligible. A litre of soft drink has a footprint of 500g CO2e, and a litre of fruit juice 900g CO2e.

    Limiting yourself to 1 litre of juice and 1 litre of soda a week is a good start to reducing your carbon footprint and has a positive impact on your health.
alimentation . bonus . manger local:
  ic√¥nes: üçÖ

    Local food reduces the transport distances of the products we consume. However, even if this may seem counter-intuitive, local food can, depending on the case, be disadvantageous in terms of greenhouse gas emissions: the impact of the origin of our products cannot be summed up by a comparison between short and long distances. The effects of scale, the centralisation of products, the efficiency of the transport used (or conversely the lack of efficiency) make the matter more complex from a carbon accounting point of view.

    Nevertheless, local food has many other positive impacts, such as supporting farmers in our regions!

    In Geneva, the "Gen√®ve R√©gion Terre Avenir" (GRTA) label identifies products from local agriculture. The https://www.geneveterroir.ch/fr/marque-de-garantie-grta-info/2443 website lists the canton's GRTA producers.

    Like some households that have already taken the plunge, you can embark on a drastic approach to reducing your waste, until you have (almost) no bins to put out.

alimentation . bonus . manger de saison:
  description: |
    Contrary to what one might imagine, the impact of this action is relatively small, as the proportion of seasonal products in the average Swiss diet is very low.

    But there are many other benefits to seasonal eating, such as lower water consumption, greater crop diversity, and less dependence on hydrocarbons (gas and oil) to heat greenhouses. What's more, the body doesn't need the same nutrients all year round, and these needs correspond to seasonal foods.

    Chicory has a lower carbon footprint than coffee. Long used as a substitute for coffee, this plant is now making a gradual comeback in our cups, for ecological and health reasons.

    Why not try chicory?
alimentation . d√©chets . r√©duire gaspillage:
  description: |
    In Switzerland, the average food waste is estimated at 90 kg of food per person per year.

    If we consider the entire value chain (i.e. from field to plate), around 2.8 million tonnes of food are wasted every year, or 330 kg per inhabitant. Energy, water, financial and human resources were needed to produce this food, so these resources are also wasted. What's more, they also have an impact on the environment.

    Reducing food waste is therefore essential if we are to avoid producing to throw away, save resources and reduce our impact on the environment!

    Our bio-waste, i.e. putrescible waste from our food (peelings, leftovers from meals, etc.),
    accounts for a large proportion of the weight of our grey bin, thus increasing the carbon footprint associated with

    compost, a rich organic substance that benefits the soil. Composting our bio-waste (either individually or collectively) helps to reduce
